##Introduction
A set of thermal conductivity calculation algorithm including NEMD,Muller-Plathe,Green-Kubo,NEGF,NMA,BTE are realized.
Besides,these calculators are controlled by a universal system which helps you to generate input files and structure files for lammps,VASP,shengbte,almode etc. and use pbs to manage your tasks.Then automatical analysis including data formating and graph generation are carried out.
